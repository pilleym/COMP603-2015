Compiler Design - Lab 1: Read Source

C# compiler and runtime

General Notes:
	C# Compiler - 
		Compiles itself and other C# programs.
		Usually used to compiler Mono and is fairly fast. 
	Mono Runtime -
		Provides JIT compiler, AOT, a library loader, garbage collector, 
			threading system, and interoperability functionality
		Base Class Library - 
			Set of classes that provide foundation for building applications
		Mono Class Library - 
			Go above the base class library. Provide functionality 
			(EX: zip files, LDAP, OpenGL)
			

Identify which files/functions are responsible for each compiler source
	(scan/lex/tokenize, parse, AST, optimization, code generation).
	scan: sgen-minor-scan-object.h (Object scanning in the nursery collection)
		  sgen-scan-object.h (generic object scan)
	lex: mono/mcs/jay/skeleton 
	tokenize: mono/mono/metadata/tokentype.h 
	AST(Represents the program in the data structure): Microsfot.Scripting.Core.csproj
	Optimization: ExpressionOptimizer.cs (Optimizes expressions ); contains optimize function
	Code Generation: OperationContractGnerationContext.cs
